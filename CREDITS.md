# Credits

We want to credit where credit is due.
This project owes thanks to the authors of this repository (see their commits),
the third-party libraries we rely on (check the dependencies),
and the diffuse pool of ideas and inspirations that shaped it.

We welcome contributions to this list!
If you feel someone or something is missing,
please submit a pull request with the suggested addition.
